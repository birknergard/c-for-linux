Exercise 1:
Consider the following - You have a multidimensional array of size [r][c] -
r rows and c cols. (r,c) are provided at run-time. Example: (r=10,c=5)(r=5,c=5)
Take input from user and store each integer into a random row. Store it
in another row if the row is already full. Then print the whole array in a nice formatting.
Then write a function that takes a pointer to a row and sorts the integers in place.

Hints: See ex0a.c and ex0b.c for how to create a multi-dimensional array dynamically.
       Use the BubbleSort() from previous exercises.
