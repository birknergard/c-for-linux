/*
Exercise 4:

Make a small library function that just prints that it is executed (aka "hello world").
Put it into func.c and make a func.h that prototypes the function.
Then make a main.c than #include func.h and calls the function. Create a makefile that compiles
both files into a program and test the program.

Rewite the makefile to produce the static library func.a, and link this library
from the main program.

Rewrite the makefile again to produce the dynamic library func.so and link this
from the main program.
